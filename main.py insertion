#The first part of the code defines a function called insertion_sort that takes an array (arr) as input and performs an insertion sort algorithm on it.
def insertion_sort(arr):
    for i in range(1, len(arr)):
        key = arr[i]
        j = i - 1
        while j >= 0 and key < arr[j]:
            arr[j + 1] = arr[j]
            j -= 1
        arr[j + 1] = key

def my_comparison(obj):
    return obj.attr1

arr = [MyClass(attr1, attr2) for i in range(75000)]
insertion_sort(arr, key=my_comparison)

#the insertion_sort function is called on the arr array, with my_comparison function as the key argument. This means that the my_comparison function will be used to determine the ordering of the elements in the arr array during the sorting process.
